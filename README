CS461 Final Project: Improved Shell

Contributors: Mykita Zolov and Nikola Kovilic
Forked from sysec-uic/xv6-public

Our modified shell provides the following functionality to users:
    - Pressing {Up Arrow} cycles backwards through commands that were previously ran
    - Pressing {Down Arrow} cycles forward through commands that were previously ran
    - Editing the currently displayed command using the {Left Arrow}/{Right Arrow}

These improvements hopefully provide the user with a more interactive and user friendly experience while using xv6 (for whatever purpose that can be)
